# Jarside Auth Handler
This plugin adds Basic Authentication to a WordPress site.

Note that this plugin requires sending your username and password with every
request, and should only be used over SSL-secured connections or for local
development and testing. Without SSL we strongly recommend using the
[OAuth 1.0a][oauth] authentication handler in production environments.

## Installing
1. Download the plugin into your plugins directory
2. Enable in the WordPress admin
3. Create a user for Jarside
4. Use Jarside to generate your articles and publish directly on your site
